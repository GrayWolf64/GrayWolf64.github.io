## Welcome to GrayWolf's Homepage!

>I can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/GrayWolf64/GrayWolf64.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files. Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

```markdown
//Something about code.

print("I will learn Rust soon")

```
